<p> My dissertation seeks to address the question:  do actors in authoritarian settings provide credible information? I investigate whether and when credible information can be extracted from the words and behaviors of agents in authoritarian settings.  These behaviors are conducted in environments where falsifying preferences or actions is often necessary, and where the information environment is poor. I designate these contexts as "low-information environments" whether they are authoritarian or even simply developing country contexts because data are often missing-not-at-random or are intentionally obscured, and this impacts the strategic behavior of actors as well as our analysis of those actions and outcomes. Incorrectly specifying or interpreting these behaviors threatens the accuracy of statistical inference and analysis of political regimes. In that sense, studying spoken and behavioral data to ascertain under what conditions individuals provide accurate information about agents' preferences or about informal expectations and institutions, is fundamental to studying authoritarian politics and drawing inferences from the data we collect.
</p>
<p>This work bridges several literatures addressing the methodological as well as substantive aspects of imperfect information in authoritarian settings. Within the authoritarian politics literature, very rarely do papers address the the non-missing-at-random character of their data. Recent work by King, Pan, and Roberts 2013, examining censorship in China, however, is representative of a recent move to examine how data are generated in authoritarian contexts. Their approach to directly analyze censorship empirically complements other work that examines the actions of agents under authoritarian settings with imperfect information (Acemoglu and Robinson 2009), as well as network-oriented studies that examine how individuals acquire information and what "credible" sources are. My dissertation integrates these methodological and substantive approaches to comprehensively study information under authoritarianism. 
</p>
<p>In order to achieve this integration, my dissertation addresses the main research question in three ways. First, I address the issue of conducting analyses in data-poor circumstances. Specifically, I examine elicited priors as a way to integrate local expertise into statistical analyses of political processes. To achieve this, I discuss a methodological technique based on a Dirichlet process to aggregate Bayesian priors. This method better incorporates expert opinion into Bayesian analyses of authoritarian contexts, where expertise may be very divergent because of the skewed information environment. I argue that the limited application of elicited priors in political science is due to both an unclear prescription for implementing it and a limited vision for its application---issues that the approach I discuss seeks to solve. Second, I apply this method directly to a small dataset of the participation of Myanmar members of parliament (MPs). This second paper demonstrates the way in which the method allows for better estimation of a complex model even using small $n$ data, but also uncovers motivations of MPs under authoritarianism that are more complex than previous work has led us to believe. While the first paper directly addresses how to elicit and use information from sources in authoritarian settings, the second paper illustrates the utility of this method to examine and interpret the behaviors of actors in authoritarian contexts as well. In the third paper, I build on these theoretical and methodological insights further through a new application and through refinement of the method.</p>
